# Contributing to Source Code: A Guide

## Key Points

1. All testing commits should be published to the testing branch.

2. To commit to the main branch, first issue a pull request. If approved, then its committed.

3. If you see an issue with the code, feel free to create an issue. When creating an issue make sure to explain how to reproduce the issue and screenshot of logs or the issue. More information helps us solve issues quicker.
